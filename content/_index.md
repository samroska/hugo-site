Full-stack Software Engineer with expierence leveraging agile and DevOps accross multiple platforms. A majority of my expierence has been within the infrastructure space working on web applications to monitor platform health, provision servers, and automate public cloud adoption.

I'm currently a part-time student at the University of Michigan studing Applied Data Science. My professional goal is to be a machine learning engineer and work within predictive analytics.

My passion projects are focused on helping other women and young girl learn how to code. I learned 99% of my skills on the job and I like to share that knowlege. I co-created a learning program in 2017, with the mission to increase diversity at an anual hack day event, that was later adopted company-wide.

I support all those who identify as a woman in STEM.
