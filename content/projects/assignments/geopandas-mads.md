The assignment asked for exploring a set of given data and then visualize that data. 
The data was of workouts completed over a period of time. Data included logitude, latitude, miles, speed, and elevation. 
I used the geopandas, seaborn, and scipy libraries for visualizing the data. 
This was the first time working with these libraries and exploring what what possible to visualize.
The original Jupyter Notebook is not made public as per the request of the professor. It was his data :).
